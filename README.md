# Rainfall-Forecasting
Rainfall prediction is a crucial application of science and technology, aiming to estimate the amount of rainfall over a specific region.
# 1.Water Resource Management:
Precise rainfall predictions are vital for effective water resource management.
They help optimize water usage, reservoir management, and irrigation planning.
By knowing when and how much rainfall to expect, authorities can allocate water resources efficiently.

# 2.Crop Productivity:
Agriculture heavily relies on rainfall.
Accurate forecasts allow farmers to plan planting, harvesting, and irrigation schedules.
Crop productivity and yield depend on timely and adequate rainfall.

# 3.Infrastructure Planning:
Urban planning, construction, and infrastructure development require accurate rainfall data.
Proper drainage systems, flood control measures, and building designs depend on rainfall patterns.

# 4.Hydrological Models:
Rainfall forecasts serve as input for hydrological models.
These models predict river flow, groundwater recharge, and flood risk.
Timely and reliable rainfall information minimizes the impact of extreme events on communities and infrastructure.

# 5.Data Collection and Preprocessing:
To predict rainfall, historical data is collected.
Features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure are considered.
Data cleaning and preprocessing remove outliers and missing values.
